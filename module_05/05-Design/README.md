- Colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand-drawn icons or illustrations, animations and fun language

## Serif/Sans-Serif

### Serif

### Sans-Serif

## Rules on Typefaces

1. Only use good and popular typefaces and play it safe
1. It is okay to use one typeface per page. If you want more, limit to 2 total
1. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality
1. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices. Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range
1. Use a font size between 16px and 32 px for "normal" text
1. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
1. For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
1. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)
1. Use less than 75 characters per line
1. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5 (the smaller/longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be). Example: 1.2 on headline, 1.31 for description below it, 1.52 for body section
1. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience). Example: -3.5 letter spacing.
1. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing.
1. Usually, don't justify text.
1. Do not center long text blocks; centering small blocks is fine though.
