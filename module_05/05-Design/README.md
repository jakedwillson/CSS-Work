## Typography

### Definition

## Serif/Sans-Serif

### Serif

- Has decorative lines on letters
- Creates a traditional look/feel
- Conveys trustworthiness
- Good for long text

### Sans-Serif

- Does not have decorative lines
- Modern look and feel
- Clean and simple
- Easier to choose for beginner designer

## Rules on Typefaces

1. Only use good and popular typefaces and play it safe
1. It is okay to use one typeface per page. If you want more, limit to 2 total
1. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality
1. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices. Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range
1. Use a font size between 16px and 32 px for "normal" text
1. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
1. For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
1. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)
1. Use less than 75 characters per line
1. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5 (the smaller/longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be). Example: 1.2 on headline, 1.31 for description below it, 1.52 for body section
1. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience). Example: -3.5 letter spacing.
1. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing.
1. Usually, don't justify text.
1. Do not center long text blocks; centering small blocks is fine though.

## Choose the Right Color

1. Make the main color match your website's personality: colors convey meaning!
1. Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
1. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.
1. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out.
1. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations.
1. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background (lighter version) for text.
1. `Text should usually not be completely black`. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting.
1. Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors. Tools like coolors will give you a `contrast ratio` which needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+)

### Specific Colors

1. Red draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion and excitement
1. Orange is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness and creativity
1. Yellow means joy, brightness and intelligence
1. Green represents harmony, nature, growth and health
1. `Blue` is associated with peace, trustworthiness and professionalism (most common)
1. Purple conveys wealth, wisdom and magic
1. Pink represents romance, care and affection
1. Brown represents nature, durability and comfort
1. Black symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

### Establish a Color System

1. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color (the grey color does not necessarily need to be a "true grey", it can be a very dark version of another color, like blue)
1. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent colors (use a tool). There should be a relationship between the main and accent color, which is why you should use a tool
1. For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" - tints (lighter) and shades (darker)

## Images

### Use Good Images

1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns.
1. Use images to support your website's message and story. Only use relevant ones!
1. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images (not generic ones!)
1. Try to show real people to trigger users' emotions
1. If necessary, crop images to fit your message

### Resources for Authentic Images

1. [unDraw](https://undraw.co/)
1. [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) allows you to reduce the file size of an image.

### Handling Text on Images

1. Method 1: Darken or brighten the image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
1. Method 2: Position text into neutral image area
1. Method 3: Put text in a box

### Some Technical Details

1. To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size (if original is 600 x 600, displayed is 300 x 300)
1. Compress images for a lower file size and better performance
1. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure that they have the exact same dimensions

## Icons

### Rules

1. Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icon packs.
1. Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different icon packs.
1. Use SVG icons or icon fonts (since you can scale indefinitely). Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!
1. Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography.
1. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text.
1. Use icons for product feature blocks.
1. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
1. Use icons as bullet points.
1. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color.
1. Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action!
1. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.
