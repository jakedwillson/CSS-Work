## Typography

### Definition

- Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed

## Serif/Sans-Serif

### Serif

- Has decorative lines on letters
- Creates a traditional look/feel
- Conveys trustworthiness
- Good for long text

### Sans-Serif

- Does not have decorative lines
- Modern look and feel
- Clean and simple
- Easier to choose for beginner designer

## Rules on Typefaces

1. Only use good and popular typefaces and play it safe
1. It is okay to use one typeface per page. If you want more, limit to 2 total
1. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality
1. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices. Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range
1. Use a font size between 16px and 32 px for "normal" text
1. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
1. For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
1. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)
1. Use less than 75 characters per line
1. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5 (the smaller/longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be). Example: 1.2 on headline, 1.31 for description below it, 1.52 for body section
1. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience). Example: -3.5 letter spacing.
1. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing.
1. Usually, don't justify text.
1. Do not center long text blocks; centering small blocks is fine though.

## Choose the Right Color

1. Make the main color match your website's personality: colors convey meaning!
1. Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
1. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.
1. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out.
1. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations.
1. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background (lighter version) for text.
1. `Text should usually not be completely black`. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting.
1. Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors. Tools like coolors will give you a `contrast ratio` which needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+)

### Specific Colors

1. Red draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion and excitement
1. Orange is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness and creativity
1. Yellow means joy, brightness and intelligence
1. Green represents harmony, nature, growth and health
1. `Blue` is associated with peace, trustworthiness and professionalism (most common)
1. Purple conveys wealth, wisdom and magic
1. Pink represents romance, care and affection
1. Brown represents nature, durability and comfort
1. Black symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

#### Generating Tints and Shades

1. [Tint & Shade Generator](https://maketintsandshades.com/)

### Establish a Color System

1. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color (the grey color does not necessarily need to be a "true grey", it can be a very dark version of another color, like blue)
1. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent colors (use a tool). There should be a relationship between the main and accent color, which is why you should use a tool
1. For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" - tints (lighter) and shades (darker)

## Images

### Use Good Images

1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns.
1. Use images to support your website's message and story. Only use relevant ones!
1. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images (not generic ones!)
1. Try to show real people to trigger users' emotions
1. If necessary, crop images to fit your message

### Resources for Authentic Images

1. [unDraw](https://undraw.co/)
1. [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) allows you to reduce the file size of an image.

### Handling Text on Images

1. Method 1: Darken or brighten the image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
1. Method 2: Position text into neutral image area
1. Method 3: Put text in a box

### Some Technical Details

1. To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size (if original is 600 x 600, displayed is 300 x 300)
1. Compress images for a lower file size and better performance
1. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure that they have the exact same dimensions

## Icons

### Rules

1. Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icon packs.
1. Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different icon packs.
1. Use SVG icons or icon fonts (since you can scale indefinitely). Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!
1. Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography.
1. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text.
1. Use icons for product feature blocks.
1. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
1. Use icons as bullet points.
1. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color.
1. Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action!
1. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.

## Shadows

### General Concepts

1. Originally, it was Skeuomorphic design (glassy/real-world ocean for example), but then it transitioned into flat design (minimal)
1. After an era of 100% flat design, we are now back to using shadows in UI design (flat design 2.0 - still minimal, but brings back shadows and depth for better usability)
1. Shadow creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is

### Use Shadows Well

1. You don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality (less shadow = serious/elegant; more shadow = playful/fun)
1. Use shadows in small doses: don't add shadows to every element!
1. Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark

### Use Shadows In the Right Situation

1. Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
1. Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
1. Use large shadows for elements that should really `float above` the interface (e.g., navigations and pop-up windows)
1. Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover). Medium-sized shadow "pulls" button closer to the user; smaller shadow "pushes" button back into the interface.
1. Bonus: experiment with glows (colored shadows)

### Important CSS Properties for Shadows

1. `box-shadow (horizontal offset) (vertical offset) (blur) (scale) (color)`, example: `box-shadow: 20px 20px 20px 10px #000`

## Border Radius

### Use Border Radius Well

1. Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious
1. Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness
1. Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections and other elements

### Notes

1. You can make an element round by giving it a border-radius of 50%

## Whitespace

- It is technically invisible, but it is one of the easiest and fastest ways of drastically improving your designs

### Why Whitespace

1. The right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern and polished
1. Whitespace communicates how the different pieces of information are related to one another
1. Whitespace implies invisible relationships between the elements of a layout

### Where to Use Whitespace

1. Use tons of whitespace between sections
1. Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
1. Use whitespace between elements
1. Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines

### How Much Whitespace

1. The more some elements belong together, the closer they should be (i.e. the "Law of Proximity")
1. Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then remove whitespace from there (too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks too crammed)
1. Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace
1. Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16 for all spacing

## Visual Hierarchy

### What is Visual Hierarchy?

1. Visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a design are the most important ones
1. Visual hierarchy is about drawing attention to the most important elements
1. Visual hierarchy is about defining a "path" for users, to guide them through the page

### Visual Hierarchy Fundamentals

1. Position important elements closer to the top of the page, where they get more attention
1. Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention)
1. Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements

### Visual Hierarchy for Text Elements

1. For text elements, use font size, font weight, color and whitespace to convey importance
1. What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links buttons, data points and icons (you can also de-emphasize less important text - like labels or secondary/additional information)

### Visual Hierarchy Between Components

1. Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow or border (or multiple)
1. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B
1. What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.

## What is User Experience (UX)

### User Interface (UI)

- UI is the visual presentation of a product. It's how the graphical interface looks and feels (layout/personality/typography)

### User Experience (UX)

- UX is the overall experience the user has while interacting with the product (does the app feel logical and well thought out? Does the navigation work intuitively? Are users reaching their goals?)

### UI And UX Design

- UI is what makes an interface beautiful
- UX is what makes an interface useful and functional
- UX design cannot exist without UI design

### UX Design Guiding Principle: Goals

- A website or application exists for a reason: a user has a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it
- Good UX design aligns the user's goals with the business' goals

### UX Rules for Usability

1. Don't design complicated layouts or reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know (like Amazon)
1. Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive
1. `Use blue text and underlined text only for links!`
1. Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 ms
1. In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan
1. Offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc. -- web apps
1. Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality) -- web apps (e.g., put the "Add Task" button at the bottom of the list if the new item will be added there, instead of some random part of the page)

### UX Rules for Website Content

1. Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don't be vague or fancy!
1. Only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear
1. Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and "smart sounding" words
1. Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc
